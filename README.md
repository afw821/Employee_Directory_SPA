# Employee Directory

**Project Title**
This is a mock employee directory which loops through an array of objects and renders a list of employees, their office number and telephone number to the page. This page is a single page application (SPA). There is only one HTML file. On the navigation bar on this page there are different links the user can click (Update, delete, verify, etc.) which are set up as event listeners. When clicked, these event listeners execute a function, which removes and adds the class of hide to elements on the page. This DOM manipulation is what makes the page appear as if there are multiple HTML files when in fact there's only one.

**Built With**
HTML5
CSS-Reset CSS
JavaScript
I created a DOM.js file which is composed of a function $. const $ function is composed of many other functions such as on, val, text, addClass, removeClass. These functions mimic jQuery methods as such, $(selector).method(content, class name, etc).
I am in the process of re-factoring the code and will add bootstrap rows and columns to make the application Mobily responsive.
